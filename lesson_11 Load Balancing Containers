Steps:
  1) In the root directory, navigate to lb-challenge and create the Docker Compose file.
  2) Set the Compose version to 3.2.
  3) Create three weather-app services:
        weather-app1
        weather-app2
        weather-app3
  4) The services should build the Dockerfile* that is in the weather-app directory.
  5) All three should have tty set to true.
  6) All three containers should be using the frontend network.
  7) Create a service called loadbalancer.
  8) It should use the Dockerfile located in the load-balancer directory.
  9) Set tty to true.
  10)The port mapping should be set to 80 on the host and 80 on the container.
  11)The load balancer should be using the frontend network.
  
  docker-compose.yml:
  version: '3.2'
  services:
     weather-app1:
       build: ./weather-app
       tty: true
       networks:
         - frontend
     weather-app2:
       build: ./weather-app
       tty: true
       networks:
        - frontend
     weather-app3:
       build: ./weather-app
       tty: true
     networks:
       - frontend

      loadbalancer:
        build: ./load-balancer
        image: nginx
        tty: true
        ports:
        - '80:80'
        networks:
        - frontend

  networks:
    frontend:
    
12) The contents of your nginx.conf file should look like the following:

  events { worker_connections 1024; }

  http {
    upstream localhost {
      server weather-app1:3000;
      server weather-app2:3000;
      server weather-app3:3000;
    }
    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name localhost;
      location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }
    }
  }
